D → Smart Market Questions
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:
The looming FTCE exam date and the crushing realization that she hasn't started studying effectively. She lies awake calculating how many weeks she has left, mentally cycling through all the content she needs to cover, and panicking about what happens if she doesn't pass. She worries about disappointing her family, delaying her career, and the financial burden of retaking the exam.

What are they secretly afraid of in life:
That she's not actually smart enough to be a teacher, that she'll fail the FTCE multiple times like some of her classmates, and that she'll end up stuck in retail forever. She's afraid of being seen as a failure by her family and friends who believe in her dreams.

What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:
She's angry at her education program for not better preparing her for the FTCE, frustrated with the Florida Department of Education for making the certification process so complicated, and mad at herself for procrastinating. She's particularly frustrated with classmates who seem to have it all figured out and make studying look effortless.

Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:

Never having enough time to study properly between work, student teaching, and coursework
Feeling overwhelmed by the massive amount of content to cover for the FTCE
Not knowing where to start or how to create an effective study plan
Biggest secret desire in life:
To feel confident and prepared walking into the FTCE exam, knowing she's going to pass on the first try. She dreams of the moment she gets her certification and can finally call herself a "real teacher."

Built-in bias to how they make decisions:
She tends to overthink decisions and seeks validation from others before acting. She's influenced by what her peers are doing and often chooses the "safe" or most popular option rather than what might be best for her specific situation.

Common words or language unique to them:
"I'm so stressed," "I don't even know where to start," "Everyone else seems to have it figured out," "I should be studying right now," "I'm such a procrastinator," "I'm not good at standardized tests," "I don't have time for this."

Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:

Study guides are boring and hard to get through
Traditional study methods require too much uninterrupted time that she doesn't have
Online courses are expensive and don't provide personalized feedback
E → Going Deep
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:

Overwhelming anxiety about the exam and future career

Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:

Excitement about starting her teaching career
Pride in overcoming a major challenge
Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:

Hard work and determination can overcome most obstacles
Education is the key to breaking cycles and creating opportunities
Everyone deserves a chance to succeed, regardless of their background
Biggest Lifestyle Desire:
To have a stable, fulfilling career as a teacher with enough income to live comfortably, travel occasionally, and eventually start a family. She wants to feel confident in her professional abilities and have work-life balance.

F → Purchasing Habits
Top 3 Decision Triggers:

Peer recommendations and social proof from other education students
Time-saving benefits that fit her busy schedule
Affordable pricing that fits her tight budget
Prior Purchases For This Pain:
She's bought a few FTCE study guides from Amazon ($50-80 total), signed up for a free Quizlet account, and purchased a $30 practice test from a third-party website. She's also spent money on planners and organization tools trying to get her study schedule together.

Price Tolerance For Offer:
She'd be willing to pay $15-25 per month for something that really works, but would need to see clear value. She's budget-conscious but understands that investing in passing the FTCE is worth it to avoid retaking fees.

Time Horizon Of Solution:
She needs something that can help her within the next 3-4 months before her exam date. She's looking for both immediate confidence building and long-term preparation.

G → Primary Wants

Wants to be: A certified teacher who feels prepared and competent
Wants to do: Pass the FTCE on her first attempt and start her teaching career
Wants to save: Time, money on retaking fees, and emotional stress

H → Empathy Map
Seeing: Classmates who seem more prepared, job postings requiring FTCE certification, countdown to exam date on her calendar, study materials piling up unused, social media posts about teaching jobs

Thinking: "I should be studying right now," "Everyone else is more prepared than me," "What if I fail?" "I don't know where to start," "I'm running out of time," "Maybe I'm not cut out for this"

Hearing: Classmates discussing their study plans, professors mentioning the importance of the FTCE, family asking about her exam date, friends making weekend plans she feels she should skip to study

Feeling: Overwhelmed, anxious, guilty, frustrated, behind, inadequate, worried, stressed, scattered

Saying: "I really need to start studying," "I'm so behind," "I don't know where to begin," "I wish I had more time," "I'm not good at standardized tests," "I'm so stressed about this exam"

Doing: Avoiding study materials, scrolling through social media instead of studying, buying study guides she doesn't use, making study schedules she doesn't follow, working extra hours to pay bills, attending classes and student teaching, staying up late worrying instead of sleeping
