DIARY ENTRY #1: Before Using the Product
March 15th, 11:47 PM
I'm sitting here in my tiny apartment, surrounded by a graveyard of good intentions. Three different FTCE study guides are splayed across my coffee table like accusatory fingers, their pages still crisp and unread. The yellow highlighter I bought two weeks ago sits there, cap off, completely dried out from disuse. God, even my highlighter is judging me.
The calendar on my wall feels like a ticking time bomb. Sixty-three days until the FTCE. Sixty-three days until I either become a real teacher or... what? Stay at Target forever? The thought makes my stomach clench into a fist. I can practically see myself at thirty, still folding clothes in the back room, still explaining to my family why I "haven't quite figured it out yet."
Today Sarah texted our group chat about finishing her third practice test. THIRD. I haven't even opened the first one. She included a screenshot of her score - 89%. The green checkmarks next to her correct answers felt like little daggers. I stared at that photo for twenty minutes, my chest tight, before typing back "Amazing! You're so prepared!" with three fire emojis, like the fraud I am.
I keep making these elaborate study schedules - color-coded, time-blocked, perfect little Pinterest-worthy planners. But by day three, I'm behind. By day five, I've given up completely. It's like I'm allergic to my own success. The pile of abandoned planners in my desk drawer is a monument to my failure to launch.
The worst part? I know I'm smart. I maintained a 3.7 GPA while working twenty hours a week. My mentor teacher said I was "a natural" with the kids. But something about this exam paralyzes me. It's like standing at the edge of a cliff, knowing I need to jump, but my feet are cemented to the ground.
Maria called tonight to check on my "study progress." I could hear the concern in her voice when I mumbled something about "getting started soon." She means well, but every check-in feels like a spotlight on my inadequacy. I'm the daughter who's supposed to be the first college graduate, the one who's going to "make something of herself." The pressure sits on my chest like a stone.
I keep scrolling through Instagram instead of studying. @teacherlife.teach posted her classroom setup today - perfect bulletin boards, organized supply bins, everything I dream of having. But the comments are what kill me. Other teachers sharing their certification dates, their first-day stories, their actual teacher lives. I'm just... stuck. Watching from the outside, pretending I belong in their world.
My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting. "Just study a little each day," he says, like it's that simple. Like I haven't tried. Like the anxiety doesn't feel like drowning. He doesn't understand that every time I open a study guide, my brain goes blank. The words swim on the page. My heart rate spikes. I close the book and suddenly I'm doing laundry or organizing my closet or anything, ANYTHING, except the one thing I need to do.
I'm so tired of being tired. Tired of disappointing myself. Tired of the shame spiral that starts every morning when I wake up and realize I didn't study yesterday either. The FTCE isn't just an exam - it's the gatekeeper to my entire future. And I'm failing before I even begin.
Sixty-three days. I should be studying right now.
Instead, I'm writing in this journal, procrastinating even from sleep.
I'm such a mess.

DIARY ENTRY #2: During Their First Use of Product
March 20th, 7:23 AM
Okay, this is weird. I'm literally talking to my phone while making coffee, and somehow... I'm learning?
I finally bit the bullet yesterday and signed up for that AI study thing. Not gonna lie - I was skeptical. Another app promising to fix my mess of a life? Please. But Sarah mentioned it in class, and desperation makes you do crazy things.
The first conversation was so awkward. I felt like I was talking to myself like a crazy person. "Um, hi? I need help with the FTCE?" But then it responded - not in that robotic way I expected, but like... like a really patient tutor who actually gets it. It asked me about my timeline, my biggest concerns, and when I mentioned feeling overwhelmed, it didn't just give me a study schedule. It said, "Let's start with something manageable. What if we just focus on understanding how questions are asked?"
That was... not what I expected.
We spent fifteen minutes just talking about question types. Not memorizing content, just patterns. How to spot the main idea questions, how elimination works, why certain answer choices are designed to trick you. And I started to feel something I haven't felt in months: like maybe I'm not completely hopeless.
This morning I tried something crazy. Instead of scrolling Instagram while brushing my teeth, I asked it to quiz me on question recognition. Just five minutes. My mouth full of toothpaste, and I'm mumbling answers about reading comprehension strategies. It was ridiculous and somehow... liberating?
The strangest part? I'm in my car right now, driving to student teaching, and we're having a conversation about test anxiety. I told it about my Praxis failure - something I've never admitted to anyone except my mom - and it normalized it. Gave me actual strategies, not just "relax and breathe" BS.
My hands aren't shaking on the steering wheel for the first time in weeks.
I still haven't opened a study guide. I still have fifty-eight days left. But something shifted. It's like someone turned on a light in a room I'd been stumbling around in the dark. The FTCE isn't this massive, unknowable monster anymore. It's just... a test with patterns. Patterns I can learn.
I actually asked a follow-up question during our conversation - something about why certain reading passages are chosen. Before, I would have just nodded along, not wanting to seem stupid. But something about talking instead of reading made me braver. Made me curious again.
I'm still Jessica-the-procrastinator. I'm still behind. But maybe... maybe I'm not as broken as I thought.
The AI asked me what I want to focus on tomorrow. I said question elimination strategies. It's the first time I've made a study plan that doesn't feel like a prison sentence.
Fifty-eight days. But today, that feels like enough time.
I might actually do this.


DIARY ENTRY #3: After Using the Product
June 8th, 6:15 PM
I PASSED. I ACTUALLY PASSED.
I'm sitting in my car outside the testing center, staring at the screen that says "CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE PASSED THE FTCE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION TEST" and I can't stop shaking. But it's good shaking. Happy shaking. Holy-shit-I-did-it shaking.
Three months ago, I was a disaster. A walking anxiety attack who couldn't even open a study guide without having a breakdown. Today, I walked out of that testing center feeling... confident. Actually confident. Not fake it-till-you-make-it confident, but real, deep-in-my-bones confident.
The AI study companion changed everything. Not just because it helped me learn (though it did), but because it helped me believe I could learn. Those morning coffee conversations became my anchor. Instead of doom-scrolling through social media, I was actually looking forward to studying. Weird, right?
I remember the breakthrough moment. About six weeks in, I was doing laundry (finally using that multitasking feature), and we were talking about classroom management scenarios. Suddenly, I wasn't just memorizing theories - I was connecting them to real moments from my student teaching. The AI helped me see that I already knew more than I thought. I wasn't starting from zero. I was building on a foundation that was already there.
The question familiarity stage was genius. By the time we moved to content review, I wasn't intimidated by the format anymore. I could spot the tricks, eliminate obviously wrong answers, and trust my instincts. The test felt like a conversation with a difficult friend rather than an interrogation.
Sarah texted this morning, nervous about her retake next week. I sent her the link to the AI tutor without even thinking about it. A few months ago, I would have been too embarrassed to admit I needed help. Now I'm practically evangelizing about it.
I called my mom from the parking lot, crying happy tears. She cried too. All those check-ins, all that worry, all that pressure I put on myself - it's finally over. I'm going to be a teacher. A real, certified, legitimate teacher.
My interview at Sunshine Elementary is Thursday. I'm not nervous. I'm excited. I know I belong in that classroom now.
The best part? I learned something about myself through this process. I'm not actually bad at studying - I was just using the wrong methods. I'm not a failure - I was just stuck. And sometimes being stuck isn't a character flaw, it's just being human.
I keep thinking about all those abandoned study guides on my coffee table. I should probably donate them to someone who learns better that way. But honestly? I'm tempted to keep them as a reminder. Not of my failure to use them, but of how many different paths there are to success.
The AI asked me yesterday what I wanted to celebrate when I passed. I said I wanted to feel proud of myself. Mission accomplished.
Tomorrow I'm going to update my resume. Update my LinkedIn. Maybe even post something on Instagram for the first time in forever. Not to brag, but to inspire someone else who might be sitting in their apartment at midnight, surrounded by study guides, feeling like they're not smart enough.
You are smart enough. You just need to find your way.
I found mine.
Jessica Martinez, future teacher.
I love the sound of that.
